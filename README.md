# Conversions Project

## Project Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook named **`coversions.ipynb`**, which demonstrates advanced media conversion techniques using Python. It includes:

- **Image to text Conversion**: Converts image data into sound (e.g., sonification or encoding visual data as audio).
- **text to audio Conversion**: Uses speech recognition or audio processing to extract text from spoken audio files.
- **Evaluating the arthematic expression given in audio with Regualr Expressions**
These conversions are useful in accessibility, multimedia processing, and AI-powered applications.
