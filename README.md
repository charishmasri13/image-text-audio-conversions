# NLP Transformers & Text-to-Speech Conversion

This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Python libraries:

1. **Sentiment Analysis** using Hugging Face's `transformers`
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** conversion using Google's `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech)

## üöÄ Project Overview

### 1. Sentiment Analysis (`transformers.ipynb`)
This notebook uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to:
- Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline.
- Analyze the sentiment of text inputs (Positive/Negative).
- Showcase simple usage of NLP pipelines in production-level models.

### 2. Text-to-Speech Conversion (`coversions.ipynb`)
This notebook utilizes `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to:
- Convert a given text string into spoken audio.
- Save the audio as an MP3 file.
- Optionally play the audio file directly in the notebook (platform-dependent).
